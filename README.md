# esri-riot-example
An example [Riot](http://riotjs.com/) application that shows how to use [esri-loader](https://github.com/Esri/esri-loader) to create a custom `<esri-map-view>` component.

This approach demonstrates how to build a Riot-focused application with the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/). Using [esri-loader](https://github.com/Esri/esri-loader) really makes the whole development process straightforward and enjoyable.

On the other hand, if you want to build an ArcGIS API-focused application _with Riot components_, see the Esri sample page [Using widgets with Riot](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/widgets-frameworks-riot/index.html).
